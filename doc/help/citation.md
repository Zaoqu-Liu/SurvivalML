BEST: a web application for comprehensive biomarker exploration on large-scale data in solid tumors
```



<p style="text-align:justify;">Data mining from RNA-seq or microarray data has become an essential part of cancer biomarker exploration. Certain existing web servers are valuable and broadly utilized, but the meta-analysis of multiple datasets is absent. Indeed, consistent performance across independent cohorts is the foundation for an excellent biomarker. Moreover, many analytical functions required by researchers remain adequately unmet by these tools. Thus, we introduce BEST (Biomarker Exploration for Solid Tumors), a web application for comprehensive biomarker exploration on large-scale data in solid tumors. BEST delivers fast and customizable functions including clinical association, survival analysis, enrichment analysis, cell infiltration, immunomodulator, immunotherapy, candidate agents, and genomic alteration. The comprehensive biomarker exploration with easy clicking via BEST dramatically advances data mining in widespread research fields, scientific discussion, and treatment discovery. BEST provides multiple cleaned-up independent datasets and diverse analysis functionalities, helping unleash the value of current data resources.<p>
